# 112 Term Project: Rhythm Maker

### Viola Xu

Description: A falling-notes rhythm maker and player. Players can make and save beat maps for 5 different audios, or play the existing maps. The ASDFJKL; keys are used as input. Score and combos are calculated based on how close to the beatmap the player presses.

To run: Make sure the audio files and map files are in the same folder as index.py. Audio files are in the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q_EZH9ec4xHgbAI9TK6_tAdQxyGdoEC8?usp=sharing. Also make sure button.py and note.py are also in the same folder. Libraries that must be installed are complexaudio, librosa, numpy, and soundfile, which can all be installed with "pip install __". Then, run index.py.

Shortcuts: while in create or play mode, press Y to pause the audio.
The shortest audio to run tests on is "clip".
